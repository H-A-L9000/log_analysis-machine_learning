Log Analysis with Machine Learning Algorithms


Abstract

Log files generated by a large HPC system produce thousands of  lines whichthat can be difficult to evaluate manually. Regardless, logs have become an effective source of data that can be used to evaluate the system status and, or detect anomalies in HPC systems. 

To the matter at hand, the admins and, or engineers that reference these log files at the granular level can overlook the root cause of a problem. 
Not only is log analysis slow and tedious, but it is susceptible to human error.
